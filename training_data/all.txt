What's the difference between Codecademy Pro and a bootcamp?
Codecademy Pro and bootcamps are both great ways to learn how to code.  The difference between the two is the time commitment and the type of instruction you receive. Codecademy Pro is designed to be much more self-directed than a bootcamp is. With Codecademy Pro, you can work through the material at your own pace and you can also choose your learning path with content that matches your goals and projects. Bootcamps are typically 12-16 week full-time courses that in-depth instruction and total immersion in the skills that you are learning. We know that not everyone has the option of learning to code full time for 3-4 months. With Codecademy Pro, you can work through the content at your own pace and on your schedule!
